## Overview
This project builds and compares interpretable machine learning models to predict individual risk, using data from a hospital construction project as a real-world proxy.

## Objective
To evaluate the trade-offs between predictive performance and interpretability by comparing Linear Regression and Decision Tree models.

## Models
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor

## Key Question
Is a more complex model always more useful in risk-sensitive environments?

## Technologies
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib
